[Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) templates for C.

## Installation

```bash
make
sudo make install

Examples will be built under `build/bin/`.

## Benchmark

While the development is still in early stage, preliminary benchmarks indicate that `custache` is around twice as fast as its JavaScript equivalent and 20 times faster than the Python equivalent.

## Status

WIP.  See [examples](/examples) for a sneak peak.
